To create a view from 5 different tables in BigQuery, you can combine the tables using SQL commands such as UNION ALL, JOIN, or WITH clauses, depending on how you want to combine the data from the tables. Here’s an example of how you can create a view by selecting and combining data from 5 different tables.

Example: Creating a View with UNION ALL
If your goal is to combine all rows from 5 tables into a single view, you can use UNION ALL. Here's an example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW `your_project.your_dataset.your_view` AS
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table1`
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table2`
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table3`
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table4`
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table5`;
Example: Creating a View with JOIN
If the tables have related data and you need to combine them using joins, here's how you can create a view using JOIN:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW `your_project.your_dataset.your_view` AS
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2, t3.column3, t4.column4, t5.column5
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table1` t1
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table2` t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table3` t3 ON t2.id = t3.id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table4` t4 ON t3.id = t4.id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table5` t5 ON t4.id = t5.id;
Example: Using WITH Clauses for Temporary Subqueries
If you need more complex processing before combining the tables, you can use WITH clauses to create temporary subqueries before creating the view:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW `your_project.your_dataset.your_view` AS
WITH table1_processed AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table1`
),
table2_processed AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table2`
),
table3_processed AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table3`
),
table4_processed AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table4`
),
table5_processed AS (
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.table5`
)
SELECT *
FROM table1_processed
JOIN table2_processed USING (common_column)
JOIN table3_processed USING (common_column)
JOIN table4_processed USING (common_column)
JOIN table5_processed USING (common_column);
Steps to Create a View in BigQuery:
Go to BigQuery Console:

Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to BigQuery.
Create a New Query:

Enter the SQL query to combine the tables, as shown above, depending on your requirement.
Save the Query as a View:

After writing and executing your query, click the "Save View" option in the query editor.
Provide a name for the view and select the dataset where you want to save it.
Confirm the View:

Once saved, the view will appear in the dataset as a virtual table, and you can query it like any other table.

there is one log table where 20 log entries should be present for one record its related to file processing so i want only final final log entry from that table whether it fail or fail and skip rest entries

To get only the final log entry for each file's processing from the log table, where multiple log entries exist for each record (e.g., 20 log entries for one record), you can achieve this by selecting the log entry that represents the final status (whether it's fail or success), while ignoring the intermediary log entries.

Assuming your log table has a structure similar to this:

file_id: The unique identifier for the file being processed.
log_status: The status of the log entry (e.g., in_progress, fail, success).
timestamp: The time when the log entry was made.
SQL Query to Retrieve Final Log Entry for Each File:
sql
Copy code
WITH final_log_entries AS (
  SELECT
    file_id,
    log_status,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY file_id ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.log_table`
  WHERE
    log_status IN ('fail', 'success')
)
SELECT
  file_id,
  log_status,
  timestamp
FROM
  final_log_entries
WHERE
  rn = 1;
Explanation:
ROW_NUMBER(): This assigns a unique row number to each log entry within each file_id, ordering by timestamp in descending order. The most recent log entry will have rn = 1.
PARTITION BY file_id: This groups the log entries by file_id so that each file's log entries are treated independently.
WHERE log_status IN ('fail', 'success'): This ensures that only the final meaningful statuses (fail or success) are considered, skipping intermediary statuses like in_progress.
WHERE rn = 1: This selects only the final log entry for each file (the one with the most recent timestamp).
Key Points:
This query assumes that the log entries contain the final status (either fail or success).
The query is flexible to be adapted if you have different statuses or if you want to customize the selection of the final entry.
By running this query, you will only get the last log entry for each file processing event, whether the file processing succeeded or failed, while ignoring the intermediate logs.

Let me know if you need further customization or have a specific scenario to address!

To create a view that combines data from 5 different tables with a condition that only the final log entry from the log table is selected (whether the status is fail or success), you can use a JOIN between the 5 tables and the log table. You will use a subquery to filter out the intermediate log entries, ensuring that only the final log entry is included.

Here’s an example of how to create a view that satisfies this requirement:

Assumptions:
You have 5 tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, table5.
You have a log_table where multiple log entries are recorded for each file, with a final status of either fail or success.
The tables share a common key, file_id, which identifies each file being processed.
The log_table has columns: file_id, log_status, timestamp, etc.
SQL to Create the View:
sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW `your_project.your_dataset.your_view` AS
WITH final_log_entries AS (
  SELECT
    file_id,
    log_status,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY file_id ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.log_table`
  WHERE
    log_status IN ('fail', 'success')
)
SELECT
  t1.*,   -- Select columns from table1
  t2.*,   -- Select columns from table2
  t3.*,   -- Select columns from table3
  t4.*,   -- Select columns from table4
  t5.*,   -- Select columns from table5
  f.log_status,
  f.timestamp
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.table1` t1
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table2` t2 ON t1.file_id = t2.file_id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table3` t3 ON t1.file_id = t3.file_id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table4` t4 ON t1.file_id = t4.file_id
JOIN `your_project.your_dataset.table5` t5 ON t1.file_id = t5.file_id
JOIN (
  SELECT file_id, log_status, timestamp
  FROM final_log_entries
  WHERE rn = 1
) f ON t1.file_id = f.file_id;
Explanation:
Final Log Subquery (final_log_entries):

This subquery finds the final log entry for each file_id. It uses the ROW_NUMBER() function to rank the log entries by timestamp within each file_id, ordering them in descending order (newest first).
The WHERE clause filters the logs to only those with a status of either fail or success.
The subquery returns only the most recent log entry for each file, as indicated by rn = 1.
JOIN with 5 Tables:

The main query joins the 5 tables (table1, table2, table3, table4, table5) using the file_id as the key.
The final log entries from the final_log_entries subquery are then joined with these 5 tables, ensuring that only the final log entry (whether it is a fail or success) is included for each file.
Selecting Columns:

In the SELECT statement, t1.*, t2.*, t3.*, t4.*, t5.* are used to include all columns from the 5 tables. You can customize this to select specific columns if needed.
The log_status and timestamp from the final log entries are included to provide the final status of the file processing.
View Creation:
This query creates a view that contains all relevant data from the 5 tables along with the final log entry for each file processing event.
The final log entry is determined based on the most recent fail or success status for each file_id.
